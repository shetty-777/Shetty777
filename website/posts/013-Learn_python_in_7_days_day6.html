      What is OOP?
    </h3>
    <p class="paragraph-indent">
      OOP stands for <em>Object Oriented Programming</em>. Like most modern
      programming languages, Python is also an object oriented language, in
      fact, it is a characteristic feature of the language. This might be a
      little tricky to understand for beginners, but I'll try my best. Buckle
      up! Because this is gonna be a bit challenging. If you are not confident
      enough, you can practice the previous lessons to get hold of the syntax.
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph">
      Everything in Python is an object, and I mean EVERYTHING (almost). Now,
      when you create a variable called <code>fruit: str = "Apple"</code>, an
      apple won't be produced in the computer, obviously. They are treated as
      objects in the sense that they have certain attributes/properties or
      qualities which describe that particular object. This is the core of
      Python and is the underlying mechanism of everything you can do in Python.
    </p>

    <h3
      style="font-family: LibreFranklin; font-weight: bold; font-size: 2.1rem"
      id="class"
    >
      Classes
    </h3>
    <p class="paragraph-indent">
      Then, we have <em>classes</em>. Classes are blueprints which are like
      frameworks for different types of objects. If 'Car' is a class, it will
      have certain properties such as brand, model name, colour, seats, fuel
      capacity, mileage or range etc.. And every single car is an object; not
      "Mahindra Thar is an object", "every individual car is an object": if it
      is a Mahindra Thar, then it's brand will be Mahindra and model will be
      Thar. I hope you understand and this analogy will be used often in this
      course. Each car is an "instance" of the class Car. So, objects are
      instances of a particular class.
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph">
      You might have noticed the word 'class' in result of the
      <code>type()</code> function:
    </p>
    <pre><code class="language-python-repl">
>>>print(type(777))
< class 'int' >
    </code></pre>
    <p class="paragraph">
      Yes! <code>777</code> is an instance of the class <code>int</code>. That's
      what I meant by "everything in Python is an object". That "Apple" you
      created was an object of type string; meaning all the data types are
      classes! Even functions are objects of the class <code>function()</code>.
      Now let's see how we can create our own classes.
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph">
      Classes are defined using the <code>class</code> key word. Every class
      must have the <code>__init__</code> method in them. Speaking of methods,
      objects have not only attributes, but also methods which are defined in
      the respective class. Essentially, methods are functions specific to that
      object; they act in some way on the object itself. If you convert 45 into
      a string with <code>str(45)</code>, that string function is a method of
      class int. The <code>.lower()</code> function is also a method, of type
      str. (Note the dot notation of the method)
    </p>
    <pre><code class="language-python">
class Car:  # A class with the name Car is defined
    def __init__(self, brand: str, model: str, year: int, colour: str):  #The parameters necessary to declare all the attributes
        self.brand: str = brand      #The attribute self.brand is declared and its value is set to the argument brand
        self.model: str = model      #The attribute self.model is declared and its value is set to the argument model
        self.year: int = year        #The attribute self.year is declared and its value is set to the argument year
        self.colour: str = colour    #The attribute self.colour is declared and its value is set to the argument colour

# Creating an instance of the class Car
my_car: Car = Car("Hyundai", "Venue", 2022, "White")

print(my_car)
print(type(my_car))
# As you might have seen in the type hint,
# 'Car' is now its own type!
# The object my_car is of the type Car

print(my_car.model)
# You can access specific attributes with the 'object.attribute' syntax


# You can also change attributes with this syntax
my_car.brand = "Rolls Royce"
my_car.model = "Spectre"
print(my_car.model)
    </code></pre>

    <h3
      style="font-family: LibreFranklin; font-weight: bold; font-size: 2.1rem"
      id="self"
    >
      What is 'self'?
    </h3>
    <p class="paragraph-indent">
      Now, you must be asking, what the heck is <code>self</code>? Self is the
      parameter that refers to a particular instance of a class. In the above
      example, 'Car' is a class and 'my_car' is an instance of that class, as
      you must have understood by now. Every instance can have different values
      for an attribute. E.g., <code>neighbour_car</code> can have the brand
      'Ford'. The <code>self</code> parameter just tells the method or the
      attribute to refer to that instance. When you printed my_car.model, the
      my_car object was passed to the self parameter automatically and it
      returned the model of my_car. If you had another car called neighbour_car,
      and you asked for neighbour_car.model, it would return something like
      Ford; because self would then become neighbour_car. A simple way to think
      about it is that a specific object replaces the <code>self</code> keyword.
      You don't need to pass it when calling a method or accessing an attribute,
      it is automatically passed. The first parameter is always self, and it is
      just a convention to call it 'self'; you can call it anything but I
      recommend not to.
    </p>

    <h3
      style="font-family: LibreFranklin; font-weight: bold; font-size: 2.1rem"
      id="methods"
    >
      Methods
    </h3>
    <p class="paragraph-indent">
      Apart from attributes, classes can also have methods, which are just
      class-specific functions. The <code>__init__()</code> function is also a
      method which runs when an instance of the class is created or initialised.
      Let's see an example:
    </p>
    <pre><code class="language-python">
from datetime import datetime

# I will not include the complete context every time
# The following function should be placed under the class after __init__()

    def age(self) -> int:
        return datetime.now().year - self.year
    # Gets the current year and subtracts the purchase year of the car

print(my_car.age(), "years")
    </code></pre>

    <p class="paragraph">
      We just created a method called age() which returns the age of the car in
      years. Here is another example to make you understand the concept:
    </p>
    <pre><code class="language-python">
# A Fruit class with an __init__() method
# and a price() method
class Fruit:
    def __init__(self, name: str, calories: int, rate: float) -> None:
        self.name: str = name
        self.calories: int = calories
        self.rate: float = rate
    
    def price(self, weight) -> int:
        return self.rate * weight  # Returns weight times rate

apple: Fruit = Fruit("Apple", 530, 150.00)
banana: Fruit = Fruit("Banana", 800, 70.00)

print("₹", apple.price(2))  # Price of 2 kilos of apples
print("₹", banana.price(5))  # Price of 5 kilos of apples
    </code></pre>
    <h3
      style="font-family: LibreFranklin; font-weight: bold; font-size: 2.1rem"
      id="dunder"
    >
      Dunder methods
    </h3>
    <p class="paragraph-indent">
      There are special methods called as 'dunder methods' which is short for
      'Double Underscore methods'. They are also called as magic methods in
      Python because they provide most of the functionality to the language.
      There are numerous dunder methods which you can look up on the Internet.
      You will be surprised to know even basic arithmetic operations like
      addition and multiplication are also dunder methods. Integer and float
      objects have a method called <code>__add__</code> which called when the +
      operator is used. Here is an example:
    </p>
    <pre><code class="language-python">
# A money class that has attributes amount and currency
class Money:
    def __init__(self, amount: float, currency: str):
        self.amount: float = amount
        self.currency: str = currency
    
    # Checks whether the currency is the same and returns a new Money object
    def __add__(self, other):
        if self.currency != other.currency:
            raise ValueError("Can't add amounts with different currencies.")
            # Oh yes, you can raise exceptions on-demand!
        return Money(self.amount + other.amount, self.currency)

balance: Money = Money(35000, "INR")
deposit: Money = Money(6000, "INR")

balance = balance + deposit
# The + operator calls the __add__ method
# The object to the right is passed as the second argument, 'other'
print(balance.amount)

# You can directly call the add method as well
deposit: Money = Money(2500, "INR")
balance = balance.__add__(deposit)
print(balance.amount)

# Create another object of a different currency and try to use the + operator
      </code></pre>

    <p class="paragraph">
      One of the most commonly used dunder method is the __str__() method.
      Without this, when you print a custom object, it just says that it is an
      object of a certain type; but nothing useful. This method/function is
      manually defined to output a user-friendly text. This method is
      automatically called when you print the object or convert it into text.
      For the Car class used earlier, this can be a string method:
    </p>
    <pre><code class="language-python">
    def __str__(self):
        return f"A/An {self.colour} {self.brand} {self.model}, purchased in {self.year}."
    
    # You can now print the car objects or convert them to text
    </code></pre>

      Inheritance of Classes
    </h3>
    <p class="paragraph-indent">
      Just like properties are inherited from generation to generation in real
      life, attributes and methods can be inherited from one class to another.
      More specifically, we can create what are 'child classes' which have the
      attributes and methods of the parent class, as well as some of their own.
      And example will clarify it:
    </p>
    <pre><code class="language-python">
class Person:
    def __init__(self, name: str, age: int):
        self.name: str = name
        self.age: int = age
    
    def introduce(self):
        print(f"Hello, my name is {self.name} and I am {self.age} years old.")

class Student(Person):  # The Person class is passed as a parameter to the Student class
    # The Student class inherits the attributes and methods of the Person class
      def __init__(self, name: str, age: int, standard: int, roll_no: int):
        super().__init__(name, age)  # Calls the __init__ method of the Person class
        self.standard: int = standard  # The Student class specific attribute
        self.roll_no: int = roll_no
      
      def introduce(self):  # This method overrides the introduce() method of the Person class
        print(f"Hello, my name is {self.name}. I am {self.age} years old and I am studying in standard {self.standard}")

class Teacher(Person):
    def __init__(self, name: str, age: int, subject: str):
        super().__init__(name, age)
        self.subject: str = subject
    
    # Though the introduce() method is not defined here, it is inherited and can be called

    def teach(self):  # A method unique to the Teacher class
        return f"[Teaching {self.subject}...]"
    </code></pre>
    <p class="paragraph">
      In the above example, we first created a Person class with attributes
      <code>name</code> & <code>age</code> and a method
      <code>introduce()</code>. We then created two child classes, Student and
      Teacher. Both the Student and the Teacher are a Person and they inherit
      the attributes and methods of the parent class, Person. When we defined
      the <code>__init__()</code> method of the child class and provided some
      parameters, the parameters of the parent class were actually overridden.
      But instead of declaring the attributes again, we use the
      <code>super()</code> function to refer to the parent class and call its
      initialisation method. After that, we can declare the child class-specific
      attributes or methods. Similar to attributes, methods will also be
      overridden if defined again. Let us create some objects.
    </p>
    <pre><code class="language-python">
me: Person = Person("S S Shetty", 16)
rutherford: Student = Student("Ernest Rutherford", 154, 13, 001)
thomson: Teacher = Teacher("J J Thomson", 169, "Physics")

me.introduce()
rutherford.introduce()
thomson.introduce()

print(thomson.teach())
    </code></pre>
    <p class="paragraph">
      Try and analyse the output and figure out which methods are being called.
      Also, find out the types of the three objects to see how they created

      More to know
    </h3>
    <ul>
      <li class="paragraph">
        You can also have what are called 'class variables' and 'class methods'.
        Essentially, these are variables and methods that are common to all
        instances of that class. You just declare class variables without the
        self. prefix and class methods with the @classmethod decorator with the
        cls parameter instead of the self parameter. There are also 'static
        methods' which are just normal functions that are defined inside a
        class. They don't have access to the instance or class variables, but
        they can be called with the class name. Since these are not often used,
        I'll be skipping the details.
      </li>
      <li class="paragraph">
        If we intend to create a class solely for storing data, which is indeed
        the most common use case, we can make use of 'dataclasses'. They
        automate the creation of some methods. They are also more concise.
      </li>
      <pre><code class="language-python">
from dataclasses import dataclass

@dataclass
class Car:
    brand: str
    model: str
    year: int
    colour: str

my_car: Car = Car("Hyundai", "Venue", 2022, "White")
print(my_car)
      </code></pre>
      <p class="paragraph">
        That's it! The above code is equivalent to the Car class we created
        earlier, but with less boilerplate code. And some dunder methods (like
        <code>__str__</code>, <code>__eq__</code>, etc.)are automatically
        created. Although you can still define other methods, it is not generally
        done.
