      is a line from the bestseller 'Atomic Habits' by James Clear. The author
      states that habits are routine actions carried out subconsciously that are
      the building blocks of our daily lives. The book is a detailed self-help
      guide about how habits can shape our lifestyle and fundamentally change
      who we are. A highly emphasised point in the book is how minuscule yet
      consistent behaviours can have remarkable effects. Nevertheless, the
      principles in the book can be imbibed in an unexpected way, to reduce the
      negative impacts on the environment.

      Pollution is one of the most treacherous evil created by man. Even climate
      change can be attributed to air pollution. Water contamination threatens
      the supply of our drinking water. Predictions indicate that there will be
      more plastics than fish in the oceans by 2050, causing irreparable damage
      to marine life and coral ecosystems. Soil pollution affects our food
      sources by reducing the quantity and quality of the produce. Thus, apart
      from moral and ethical obligations, we must restore and preserve our
      environment by controlling all sorts of environmental harm for our welfare
      and survival. By developing persistent habits, we can achieve drastic
      progress concerning the environment.
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph-indent">
      Even though we, the citizens, have a huge responsibility and our actions
      are very impactful in mitigating the effects of air pollution, the primary
      mission for reducing fossil fuel usage and advancing renewable energy
      production is of the governments, authorities and businesses. On the other
      hand, the pollutants of soil and water are more noticeable and actionable
      even by ordinary people. Although municipalities are responsible for
      disposing of household waste, we can reduce the amount of waste produced
      in the first place. Here are five of my ideas that we can adopt in our
      daily lives to reduce waste and promote recycling:

      1. Composting for organic gardening
    </h3>
    <p class="paragraph-indent" id="1">
      Almost all of the waste produced by humans ends up in either the seas or
      landfills. The food waste in such disposal areas undergoes bacterial
      decomposition releasing <abbr data-title="Land Fill Gas">LFG</abbr>,
      mainly consisting of methane, which is a potent greenhouse gas. A survey
      said that a particular landfill in Mumbai was emitting around 10 tonnes of
      methane per hour! However, food waste can be used for a better purpose
      while reducing its emissions: Composting. Composting can be used to make
      natural fertiliser and to grow our own healthy and nutritious vegetables.
      The best part is that it does not produce methane. Organic gardening also
      diminishes the effects of pesticides on our health. If someone is feeling
      very adventurous, they can also try vermiculture. Not everyone has the
      space available for composting, but if one does, composting domestically
      can be a huge win-win for both the environment and us.

      2. Upcycling and Repurposing to revive waste
    </h3>
    <p class="paragraph-indent" id="2">
      Arts and crafts are very popular hobbies around the world. They provide
      relaxation and allow our creativity to thrive. Art requires talent and to
      execute our vision, we need equipment. However, instead of purchasing
      supplies, we can use <em>'waste'</em> as material for arts and crafts.
      Reusing discarded articles to make something better is called
      <b>upcycling</b>. It can also provide an ampler canvas for our
      imagination. Bottles can be painted for home decor and cardboard can be
      sculpted into almost anything. Other than preventing us from buying raw
      materials, it is financially beneficial as one can turn it into a business
      by selling their creations as designer products. <b>Repurposing</b> is
      even easier; it means utilising <em>'useless'</em> objects for some
      advantageous purpose. For example, we can use a broken mug as a pen or
      cutlery holder. As J.R.D.Tata once said,
      <i>"Uncommon thinkers reuse what common thinkers refuse."</i> Hence,
      before throwing something away, we should take a look from a different
      angle to give it a new life

      3. Shopping wisely for sustainability
    </h3>
    <p class="paragraph-indent" id="3">
      Plastic is widely available because of its versatility. Today, it is found
      everywhere, mostly in the form of packaging. It is used to pack
      foodstuffs, but is there a need for plastic packaging of such products? We
      can't change the market but we can change our grocery buying practices.
      Instead of acquiring frozen greens with layers of plastic cover at the
      supermarket, we can buy from local vendors and hawkers. While reducing
      plastic, it will also provide financial support to them. In addition, most
      of them are nearer to us than markets, and so will save us some
      travelling. Not everything is sold by peddlers, so when we do go shopping,
      we should be conscious consumers.

      The most basic is carrying our own reusable bags. Furthermore, we should
      try to buy goods that can be stocked in bulk as much as possible. It is
      both more cost-effective and uses less packaging. We should also try to
      support businesses that are committed to sustainability. An example is
      <a href="https://phool.co" class="p-link"
        >a startup in Uttar Pradesh that makes incense sticks and cones from
        flowers</a
      >
      used in temples, which blocks them from reaching rivers and polluting
      them; or another
      <a href="https://saathipads.com" class="p-link"
        >startup in Prayagraj that makes biodegradable sanitary pads from banana
        stalks</a
      >. They can be obtained through online marketing. Such items may cost more
      than conventional ones as they are still small-scale. Nevertheless
      spending a few more rupees for our surroundings is in no way a loss.

    <p class="paragraph-indent">
      Another idea is to give up a little bit of luxury and choose simplicity.
      Instead of celebrating occasions with crackers and balloons, we could just
      light a candle. My family has been planting a sapling on our birthdays for
      a few years. We can take up such resolutions towards nature as well. And
      when we are hosting a gathering, we should take a few minutes to convey
      the importance of reducing single-use plastics. Some companies are making
      biodegradable or
      <a href="https://ediblepro.com" class="p-link">even edible cutleries</a>.
      Using such products at festivities is healthier and can serve as good
      conversation starters.

      4. Encouraging circular consumption
    </h3>
    <p class="paragraph-indent" id="4">
      Ed Begley Jr., an American actor and environmentalist, said,
      <i
        >"If you're not buying recycled products, you're not really
        recycling."</i
      >
      We should not only generate recycled items but also consume them to take
      our place in the sustainable supply chain. Circular consumption refers to
      using, reusing, and recycling resources in a continuous loop. Recycled
      goods are generally cheaper and easier to make, so we should endorse them
      more. For example, instead of buying new devices, we can get refurbished
      ones for a lower price. <em>Refurbished</em> means the damaged components
      are repaired or replaced, so it is an advantageous bargain. E-waste is one
      of the hardest to deal with, so purchasing second-hand or reconditioned
      gadgets is mutually beneficial. We can resell or donate old items such as
      books and electronics. Therefore, the items are used for longer and made
      the most out of. Even if we salvage as much as we can from junk, there
      will be some parts rendered unusable. In that case, we must give to
      recycling or at least dispose of them properly to become a part of the
      circular economy.

      5. Organising and participating in events
    </h3>
    <p class="paragraph-indent" id="5">
      Not only reducing the waste produced, but also removing the waste we have
      already generated should also be our priority. We need to become aware and
      educate others about the importance of safeguarding our surroundings. The
      best way to do that is by conducting awareness programmes. Some surveys
      said that nearly 90% of the respondents were aware of plastic littering,
      but were still using it because of convenience. Such events might erase
      that mindset. We can also orchestrate or participate in clean-up
      activities. The least we could do is request elders to fund non-profits
      that do carbon offsetting services or clean-up projects like those of
      beaches and oceans. Whilst lessening pollution, they also make our cities
      and towns visually appealing.

      What we need to realise is that blaming manufacturers for producing and
      promoting plastic is absurd; because consumers drive the manufacturers'
      methods of production. If we demand change, the companies will change for
      their own sake. Several big companies today are taking advantage of the
      trend by claiming to be "eco-friendly" while hiding huge caveats for
      hideous intentions. This is termed <em>'Greenwashing'</em>. We should not
      fall for such traps and should do some research and support firms that
      actually want to have an impact.

      Individually, all of these steps might seem impactless. Yet every tiny
      action we take adds up. We should never think that individual measures
      would have no effect. As the poem 'Little Things' by Julia Carney says,
      "Little drops of water [...] Make the mighty ocean [...]". We have to act
      towards the good of our environment. Yet, the outcome of only a few people
      or households employing these habits is going to be inconsequential. That
      is why it is critical to raise awareness and get as many people to join
      the movement towards a better world.

      Humans are not as efficient as nature, because nothing in nature is
      futile. Whereas waste is an inevitable consequence of the human way of
      life. We must attempt to make the best out of waste. The repercussions of
      our environmental actions have returned to us like a boomerang. It is high
      time we stop throwing it and take responsibility. The trendy statement,
      <em>There is no 'Plan'et B</em>, is not just for social media posts; it is
      the frightening reality we all need to be aware of. Corporations also have
      the responsibility to make sure that waste is disposed of properly.
      Industries must monitor and treat harmful effluents. We have to let go of
      our short-term gains and proceed to work for the collective well-being of
      everyone in this world, like a family; this is the message conveyed by the
      motto <i>Vasudaiva Kutumbakam</i>. Not all the points stated here can be
      carried out by all, but by adopting these habits as much as possible, we
      can provide our meagre yet invaluable contribution to making this
      magnificent earth a clean and safe abode for all of us.

      This is the other essay I spoke about in the article 'Environmental

      This is also a very well curated and comprehensive essay; however, I do
